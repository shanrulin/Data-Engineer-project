# Project: Data Pipelines with Airflow
A startup company called Sparkify is interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Also, the company has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines, so Airflow is introduced to achieve the goal.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.
